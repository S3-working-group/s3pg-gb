## Facilitate Meetings

Choose someone to facilitate a meeting. Even an inexperienced facilitator can help to focus a meeting and make a positive difference.

-   prepare an agenda of topics
-   select a facilitator who:
    -   facilitates a suitable activity or format for each topic
    -   holds the space, keeps the time and navigates the agenda during the meeting
    -   facilitates an evaluation of the meeting at the end
