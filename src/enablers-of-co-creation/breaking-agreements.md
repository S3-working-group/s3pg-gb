## Breaking Agreements

-   is sometimes **necessary**...
-   ...but may come at a **cost** to the community
-   be accountable!
    -   **clean up** disturbances
    -   **follow up** ASAP with those affected or accountable
    -   **initiate changes** instead of repeatedly breaking the same agreement
