## Circle (cont.)

-   **semi-autonomous**
    -   a circle acts within the constraints of their domain
    -   each circle can create value autonomously
-   **self-governing**:
    -   a circle continuously decides what to do to account for their domain, and sets constraints on how and when things will be done.
