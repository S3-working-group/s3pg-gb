## Governance vs. Operations

Tracking, reviewing and evolving decisions made to achieve objectives enables an organization to continuously learn and improve.

_Does it require or benefit from an individual or group decision?_

-   yes: governance
    -   not covered by a previous agreement
    -   needs to be agreed, decided or amended
-   no: operations
    -   covered by previous agreement (those accountable are free to act)
    -   needs to be done
