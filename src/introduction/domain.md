## Domains

{{define:domain}}

All domains are within the overall domain of an organization and may overlap and/or be fully contained within other domains.

Domains are delegated to people (e.g. to a unit, department, team or individuals), who take accountability for the domain, within its defined constraints on influence and autonomy.

## Delegating Domains

Those delegating a domain (the _delegators_) still retain overall accountability for that domain, and often define:

-   **key responsibilities** (essential work and decision making being delegated)
-   **constraints to autonomy and influence** for those the domain is delegated to, usually related to the organization itself (e.g. budget, resources, level of delegation, reporting)

## Drivers and Domains

A domain can be defined in relation to an organizational driver - known as the domainâ€™s **primary driver** - by the set of sub-drivers the organization may benefit from addressing when responding to that driver: 

-   **key responsibilities**: following directly from the domain's primary driver
-   **constraints**: relating to the organization's wider context

-   accountability applies to all agreements, including the organization itself, circles, and roles
-   everyone's primary accountability is for effective collaboration in response to organizational drivers
-   individuals and groups are accountable for their work, ongoing learning and development, with the organization providing necessary support
-   everyone in an organization is accountable for aligning action with organizational values
