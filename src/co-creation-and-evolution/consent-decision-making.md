## Consent Decision Making

![right,fit](img/agreements/cdm-condensed.png)

**A (facilitated) group process for decision making.**

-   invite objections, and integrate the wisdom they reveal, to evolve proposals or existing agreements
-   withholding objections can harm the objectives of a group or organization
-   unresolved objections prevent proposals from becoming agreements
-   proposals only need to be *good enough for now and safe enough to try* until the next review

### Implicit Contract of Consent

-   In the absence of objections against an agreement, I intend to follow through on the agreement to the best of my ability.
-   I agree to share objections as I become aware of them.
