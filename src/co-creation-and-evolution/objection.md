## Objection

{{define:objection}}

Objections contain information that reveals:

- a certain or likely consequence of harm (not considered safe enough to try)
- ways to improve proposals, decisions, existing agreements or actions

---

### Qualify Objections

It's the accountability of individuals to raise potential objections. 

Those accountable for the action or (proposed) agreement in question, are responsible for *considering arguments and addressing qualified objections.*

Withholding objections can harm the ability of individuals, groups or
the whole organization to respond to organizational drivers.

Being able to raise *potential* objections at any time means decisions only need *to be good enough for now and safe enough to try*.

### Qualify Objections (cont.)

_How would doing this impede - or miss an opportunity to improve - flow of value to any organizational driver?_

Objections stop: 

-   current and planned action
-   people from executing on decisions
-   existing agreements from continuing without being reconsidered
-   proposals from becoming agreements

### Understanding Objections

Some Helpful Questions:

-   How does the argument relate to this specific proposal or agreement?
-   Does the argument reveal how a (proposed or current) **action or agreement**:
    -   harms response to any organizational driver?
    -   can be improved right now?
    -   prevents or diminishes someone's contribution towards responding to a driver?
    -   is in conflict with the organization's values?
    -   is considered not ‘safe enough’ to try?

### Concerns

A **concern** is an _opinion_ that doing something (even if already considered _good enough for now and safe enough to try_) **might** impede – or miss an opportunity to improve – flow of value to an organizational driver.

In consent decision making, concerns:

-   can inform ways to further evolve agreements (including evaluation criteria and frequency of evaluation) 
-   are heard if there is time or they are considered important
-   are recorded in the logbook

If people believe a proposal may not be ‘safe enough to try’, they can raise concerns as objections to check with others about likelihood of harm.
