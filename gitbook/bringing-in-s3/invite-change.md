## Invite Change

**A way for individuals to initiate and facilitate change.**

-   be the change you want to see
-   use and adapt S3 patterns to address drivers when it's helpful to do so
-   tell the story about how and why you are using patterns from S3, including documenting outcomes, successes and failures
-   invite others to experiment with you
