**Multi-stakeholder collaboration and alignment towards a shared driver.** 

-   improves potential for equivalence between various entities
-   increases cross-departmental/organizational alignment

-   suitable for one-off projects, or ongoing collaboration

**Note:** a service organization is often referred to as a **backbone organization**.
