## Peach Organization

![right,fit](img/structural-patterns/peach-organization.png)

Deliver value in complex and competitive environments through **decentralization** (of resources and influence) and **direct interaction** between those creating value and the customers they serve.

-   circles on the periphery deliver value in direct exchange with the outside world (customers, partners, communities, municipalities etc.) 
-   the center provides internal services to support the organization
-   periphery stewards the monetary resources and steers the organization
-   link domains as required to flow information and influence and address dependencies
