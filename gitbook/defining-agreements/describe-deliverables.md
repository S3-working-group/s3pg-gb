## Describe Deliverables

A **deliverable** is something which is provided as a result of an agreement in response to a driver. Deliverables include products, raw materials, services, experiences and transformations.

In the context of an agreement, clearly describing deliverables supports shared understanding:

-   include the necessary amount of detail
-   reference other documents when helpful or necessary
