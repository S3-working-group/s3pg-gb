Transparency about the state of all work items currently pending, in progress or completed.

-   valuable for self-organization and pull-systems
-   system must be accessible to everyone affected
-   **analog**: post-its on a wall, or index cards, magnets and white board
-   **digital**: Trello, Kanbanery, Leankit, Jira, Google Sheets, etc.
