## Representative (role)

Representatives (a.k.a. links):

-   stand for the interests one group in another group
-   are selected for a limited term
-   participate as full members in the **governance decisions** of the circle they are delegated to, and can:
    -   raise items for the agenda
    -   participate in forming proposals
    -   object to agreements and proposals (when there is reason to do so)
