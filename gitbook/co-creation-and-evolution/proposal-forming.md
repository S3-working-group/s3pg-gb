### Proposal Forming Steps

- **Consent to driver**: _Is this driver relevant for us to respond to? Is the driver statement an accurate description of what is happening and what is needed?_
- **Deepen shared understanding of driver**: invite essential questions to understand more detail about the driver.
- **Collect considerations** phrased as questions relating to possible solutions. Questions either reveal constraints (information gathering questions) or possibilities (generative questions).
- **Answer** any information gathering questions if possible.
- **Prioritize** considerations.
- **Gather ideas** as possible ingredients for a proposal.
- **Design a proposal** for addressing the driver considering the creative ideas and information gathered so far. This is usually done by a smaller group (tuners).
